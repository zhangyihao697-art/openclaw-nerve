# Nerve

**The cockpit OpenClaw deserves.**

*OpenClaw is powerful. Nerve is the interface that makes people say “oh, now I get it."*

## Why Nerve exists

Chat is great for talking to agents.
It is not enough for operating them.

The moment you care about visibility, control and coordination over your agents, the thread gets too small. You want the workspace, sessions, taskboard, editor, usage, and agent context in one place.

*Nerve is that place.*

## Why it feels different

### ✨ Fleet control, not just chat
Run multiple agents from one place. Each agent can have its own workspace, subagents, memory, identity, soul, and skills, while Nerve gives you a single control plane to switch context, inspect state, and operate the whole fleet.

### ✨ Voice that feels built in
Push-to-talk, wake word flows, explicit language selection, local Whisper transcription, multilingual stop and cancel phrases, and multiple TTS providers. Voice is part of the product, not an afterthought.

### ✨ Full agent operating context
Each agent can have its own workspace, memory, identity, soul, and skills. Nerve lets you inspect, edit, and manage that context live, without guessing what an agent knows, where it works, or how it is configured.

### ✨ A real operating layer
Crons, session trees, kanban workflows, review loops, proposal inboxes, and model overrides. Nerve gives agent work an operating surface instead of leaving it trapped inside chat history.

### ✨ Rich live output
Charts, diffs, previews, syntax-highlighted code, structured tool rendering, and streaming UI that makes agent responses easier to inspect.

> <summary>What you can do with it</summary>
> 
> - **Talk to your agent by voice** and hear it answer back naturally
> - **Browse and edit the workspace live** while the conversation is still happening
> - **Watch cron runs as separate sessions** instead of treating automation like a black box
> - **Delegate work onto a kanban board** and review what came back
> - **Ask for a chart** and get a real chart, not a code block pretending to be one
> - **Track token usage, costs, and context pressure** while long tasks run
> - **Inspect subagent activity** without losing the main thread
> - **Switch between per-agent workspaces and memory** without losing context
> - **Inspect each agent’s identity, soul, and skills** from the UI
> - **Delegate subagent work inside a larger agent fleet** instead of treating everything as one thread

## Get started

### One command

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/daggerhashimoto/openclaw-nerve/master/install.sh | bash
```

> *The installer handles dependencies, clone, build, and then usually hands off straight into the setup wizard. Guided access modes include localhost, LAN, Tailscale tailnet IP, and Tailscale Serve.*


### Pick your setup

- **[Local](docs/DEPLOYMENT-A.md)** — Run Nerve and Gateway on one machine
- **[Hybrid](docs/DEPLOYMENT-B.md)** — Keep Nerve local, run Gateway in the cloud
- **[Cloud](docs/DEPLOYMENT-C.md)** — Run Nerve and Gateway in the cloud

<details><summary><strong>Manual install</strong></summary>

```bash
git clone https://github.com/daggerhashimoto/openclaw-nerve.git
cd openclaw-nerve
npm install
npm run setup
npm run prod
```

</details>



<details><summary><strong>Updating</strong></summary>


```bash
npm run update -- --yes
```

Fetches the latest release, rebuilds, restarts, verifies health, and rolls back automatically on failure.

</details>

<details><summary><strong>Development</strong></summary>

```bash
npm run dev # frontend — Vite HMR on :3080
npm run dev:server # backend — watch mode on :3081
```

**Requires:** Node.js 22+ and an OpenClaw gateway.
</details>


## How it fits into OpenClaw

Nerve sits in front of the gateway and gives you a richer operating surface in the browser.

```text
Browser ─── Nerve (:3080) ─── OpenClaw Gateway (:18789)
 │           │
 ├─ WS ──────┤ proxied to gateway
 ├─ SSE ─────┤ file watchers, real-time sync
 └─ REST ────┘ files, memories, TTS, models
```

OpenClaw remains the engine. Nerve gives it a cockpit.

**Frontend:** React 19 · Tailwind CSS 4 · shadcn/ui · Vite 7 
**Backend:** Hono 4 on Node.js

## Security

Nerve binds to `127.0.0.1` by default, so it stays local unless you choose to expose it.

When you bind it to the network (`HOST=0.0.0.0`), built-in password authentication protects the UI and its endpoints. Sessions use signed cookies, passwords are stored as hashes, WebSocket upgrades are authenticated, and trusted connections can use server-side gateway token injection.

For the full threat model and hardening details, see **[docs/SECURITY.md](docs/SECURITY.md)**.
